- Handling user input and events
- Using localStorage to persist data
- Designing responsive and visually appealing UI with CSS

Challenges Faced and how I solved them

- One challenge was keeping tasks stored even after the page refreshed. I solved this by using `localStorage` to save and retrieve tasks as JSON.
